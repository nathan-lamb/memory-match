# memory-match
Memory game

A simple game which tests your memory:

1. click on a card to turn it over
2. remeber the number
3. click on another card to turn it over
4. if the two cards match: Good work!
5. if the two cards don't match they will turn back over and you will start again
6. the game ends when all cards have been matched

This is a simple program written with vanilla Javascript and HTMl as a form of exercise to keep my basic Javascript skills sharp and to practice DOM Event Handling
